This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The current db is a simple json server that manages a db.json file locally. In order to run the app, you will need to open up 2 terminal windows.  In the first window, execute {npm start}. In the second, execute {npm run dev-server}.  This will allow you to run the app locally.
